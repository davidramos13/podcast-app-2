# Podcast App - Frontend Challenge for Inditex (Image)

This repo covers all requirements set for the challenge. It uses React, Typescript, Redux Toolkit / RTK Query, Vite for bundling, and many ways to do styling (twin.macro which combines CSS-in-JS with Tailwind, and also MUI).

### THIS IS IN PROGRESS! There are some pending tasks I expect to deliver by Tuesday 17th:

- Finish connecting audio related functionality (related UI is ready now)
- Unit testing
- Some last moment improvements around like error handling

## Instructions

To run in Development mode, use this command:

```
npm run dev
```

For Production mode you need to generate the build first if it doesn't exist. This will generate a dist folder with the final assets. After that you can run the site with the serve command:

```
npm run build
npm run serve
```
